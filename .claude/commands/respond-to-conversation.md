# Respond to FreeScout Conversation

Provide a FreeScout conversation URL and I'll fetch the full conversation, analyze it, generate a professional response draft in HTML format, and **create a note** in FreeScout for your team to review before sending.

## Usage

**Paste your FreeScout conversation URL:**

Example formats accepted:
- `https://helpdesk.veronalabs.com/conversation/9491`
- `https://helpdesk.veronalabs.com/manage/conversations/view/9491`
- Just the conversation ID: `9491`

## What I'll Do

1. **Fetch the Conversation**
   - Get full conversation details via FreeScout API
   - Load all message threads
   - Extract customer information
   - Get conversation history

2. **Analyze the Issue**
   - Identify plugin (WP SMS / WP Statistics)
   - Categorize issue type (Bug / Question / Feature / Setup)
   - Determine priority level
   - Extract key details (versions, errors, etc.)
   - Search knowledge base for similar issues

3. **Generate Response Draft (HTML Format)**
   - **IMPORTANT**: Read and follow `docs/customer-communication-guidelines.md` for ALL responses
   - Keep responses SHORT and CONCISE (avoid long lists and overwhelming details)
   - Use natural, conversational tone (warm, friendly, empathetic)
   - Match customer's energy and emotion level
   - Personalized with customer's first name only
   - Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
   - Use lists ONLY when absolutely necessary (max 3-4 items)
   - Always end with "Best regards," (no name or team signature after)
   - **Formatted in HTML (not Markdown) for FreeScout compatibility**

4. **Create a Note in FreeScout**
   - **Automatically creates an internal note** in the conversation
   - Contains the suggested response draft
   - Support team can review before sending
   - Easy to copy and send when ready

5. **Provide Context**
   - Summary of the issue
   - Recommended actions
   - Relevant KB articles
   - Whether to escalate (if needed)
   - Suggested templates (if applicable)
