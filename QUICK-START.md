# Quick Start Guide - VeronaLabs Support

## For Solo Support Team Member

This guide will get you up and running with the VeronaLabs support system in 5 minutes.

## The Fastest Way to Handle Tickets

### Step 1: Open This Project in Claude Code
You're already here if you're reading this!

### Step 2: Handle Your First Ticket

When you get a new ticket in FreeScout:

1. **Copy the ticket content** from FreeScout (just select and copy the user's message)

2. **Type:** `/freescout-import` in Claude Code

3. **Paste the ticket content** when prompted

4. **Get instant results:**
   - Automatic categorization (WP SMS vs WP Statistics)
   - Priority level (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
   - Suggested solution (if similar issue exists)
   - Ready-to-use professional response

5. **Copy the response** back to FreeScout and send!

### That's It!

The whole process takes less than 2 minutes per ticket.

## Other Useful Commands

### Quick Commands
- `/quick-categorize` - Just categorize without full response (faster)
- `/draft-response` - Generate custom response for specific scenario
- `/kb-search` - Search for solution in knowledge base

### When You Have a Bug
- `/create-bug-report` - Format the bug report properly
- `/github-issue` - Create GitHub issue for WP SMS or WP Statistics
- `/template-use bug-confirmed` - Send bug confirmation to user

### When You Need Documentation
- `/wpsms-help` - Quick access to WP SMS docs
- `/wpstats-help` - Quick access to WP Statistics docs

### Build Your Knowledge Base
After solving a new issue:
- `/kb-add` - Document the solution for future reference

## Response Templates Available

Use `/template-use [template-name]`:

- **first-response** - "Thanks for contacting us, I'm looking into this..."
- **setup-guide** - Complete setup walkthrough
- **troubleshooting-request** - "Can you provide more info..."
- **bug-confirmed** - "Yes, this is a bug, we're working on it..."
- **feature-request-response** - "Thanks for the suggestion..."
- **resolved-closing** - "Great! Issue is resolved..."
- **escalation** - "I've escalated this to developers..."
- **compatibility-issue** - "This is a compatibility issue with..."
- **documentation-link** - "Here's the documentation..."
- **follow-up** - "Following up on your ticket..."

---

## Tips for Efficiency

1. **Use `/freescout-import` for 90% of tickets** - It's the all-in-one command

2. **Build your knowledge base as you go** - Every time you solve something new, use `/kb-add`

3. **Customize templates** - Edit files in `templates/responses/` to match your style

4. **Keep GitHub in sync** - Use `/github-issue` for bugs and features to track them properly

5. **Reference docs quickly** - Use `/wpsms-help` and `/wpstats-help` instead of opening browser
