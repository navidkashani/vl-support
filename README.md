## Quick Start

### 1. Open in Claude Code

Open this project directory in Claude Code to access all support automation features.

### 2. Available Slash Commands

Type `/` in Claude Code to see all available commands. Key commands include:

- `/analyze-ticket` - Analyze and categorize a support ticket
- `/draft-response` - Generate a professional support response
- `/troubleshoot` - Create troubleshooting steps for an issue

### 3. Using Templates

Pre-written response templates are available in [templates/responses/](templates/responses/):

- `first-response.md` - Initial ticket acknowledgment

## Typical Support Workflow

### For New Tickets

1. **Analyze**: Use `/analyze-ticket` to categorize and prioritize
2. **Search**: Use `/kb-search` to find existing solutions
3. **Respond**: Use `/draft-response` or `/template-use` to create response
4. **Document**: If new issue, use `/kb-add` to add to knowledge base

### For Bug Reports

1. **Standardize**: Use `/create-bug-report` to format the report
2. **Confirm**: Use the `bug-confirmed.md` template to respond
3. **Track**: Add to GitHub issues or internal tracking system

### For Feature Requests

1. **Acknowledge**: Use `feature-request-response.md` template
2. **Evaluate**: Forward to product team
3. **Update**: Keep user informed of status

## Knowledge Base

The [knowledge-base/](knowledge-base/) directory contains documented solutions organized by:

- **WP SMS issues**: SMS gateway problems, notification issues, integration help
- **WP Statistics issues**: Tracking problems, performance optimization, GDPR compliance
- **General issues**: WordPress compatibility, common conflicts, server requirements
- **Compatibility**: Version requirements, known conflicts, compatibility matrices

Use `/kb-search` to quickly find relevant articles or `/kb-add` to document new solutions.

## Customization

### Adding New Commands

1. Create a new `.md` file in `.claude/commands/`
2. Add frontmatter with description:
   ```markdown
   ---
   description: Brief description of the command
   ---
   ```
3. Write the command instructions
4. The command will be automatically available as `/command-name`

### Adding Templates

1. Create a new `.md` file in `templates/responses/`
2. Use placeholders in [BRACKETS] for customizable content
3. Update `/template-use` command to include the new template

### Expanding Knowledge Base

1. Use `/kb-add` command, or
2. Manually create articles following the format in `knowledge-base/README.md`

## Best Practices

- **Consistency**: Use templates and commands to maintain consistent support quality
- **Documentation**: Always document new issues in the knowledge base
- **Analysis**: Start with `/analyze-ticket` to ensure proper categorization
- **Search First**: Check knowledge base before drafting responses
- **Update**: Keep knowledge base articles current with plugin updates
