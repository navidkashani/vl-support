## üöÄ How to Use Going Forward

### Monthly Analysis
Run this to track trends:
```bash
cd scripts
./fetch-conversations.sh 100
python3 analyze-freescout.py
```

Or use: `/learn-from-freescout` command

### When Handling Tickets
1. Use `/freescout-import` - now smarter with real patterns
2. Use `/kb-search` - now has articles for top issues
3. Reference new KB articles for gateway and visitor count issues

## üìà Next Steps (Recommended)

1. **Monitor Effectiveness**
   - Track if new KB articles reduce repeat tickets
   - Run monthly analysis to see trends

2. **Expand KB**
   - Create WooCommerce integration guide (common issue)
   - Create tracking method migration guide (common confusion)
   - Add gateway-specific troubleshooting for each provider

3. **Improve Feature Request Workflow**
   - 31% of tickets are features - needs process
   - Consider GitHub issue automation for feature requests

## üí° Key Insight

Your support data shows:
- **Well-handled tickets** (91% closed)
- **Clear pain points** (gateways, bot detection)
- **Active user base** (lots of feature suggestions)
- **Need for better onboarding** (setup confusion common)

The knowledge base articles I created address your two most common issues directly from real user problems.
