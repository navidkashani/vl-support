## Examples

### ‚ùå Bad Response (Too Long, Too Many Lists)

```
Hi Rebecca,

Thank you for your message. Here are the steps you need to follow:

1. Go to your website
2. Fill out the form
3. Check WP SMS ‚Üí Subscribers
4. Verify the phone number appears

If it's not working, check:
- Form ID is correct
- Field names match
- Group ID exists
- Code is in the right place

Please provide:
- Form ID
- Field names
- Error messages

Let me know if you need help.
```

### ‚úÖ Good Response (Concise, Personal, Natural)

```
Hi Rebecca,

Perfect! You're all set with the code.

Now just test it out - fill out your form with a test phone number, then check
**WP SMS ‚Üí Subscribers** to make sure it shows up in your group.

If it doesn't appear, it's usually just the form ID or field names that need
tweaking. Just let me know and I'll help you get it sorted!

Best regards,
```
