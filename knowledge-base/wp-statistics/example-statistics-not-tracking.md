**Last Updated**: 2025-10-22
**Keywords**: not tracking, no statistics, visits not recorded, page views not counting

## Problem Description

WordPress visitors are not being tracked by WP Statistics. The dashboard shows no new visits or page views, even though the site is receiving traffic.

## Affected Versions

- Plugin version: All versions
- WordPress version: All versions
- PHP version: All supported versions

## Symptoms

- Dashboard shows zero or very low visit counts
- Statistics appear "frozen" - no new data being recorded
- Page view counts not incrementing
- Visitor information not being captured

## Common Causes

1. **Caching Plugin Conflicts**
   - Page caching preventing tracking script execution
   - JavaScript caching issues
   - CDN caching

2. **Incorrect Tracking Method**
   - JavaScript tracking disabled when needed
   - PHP tracking not working properly

3. **Privacy Settings**
   - Hash IP addresses misconfigured
   - Excluded IP ranges too broad
   - User consent not obtained (GDPR)

4. **Bot/Crawler Filtering**
   - Legitimate users being filtered as bots
   - User agent detection issues

5. **Plugin Conflicts**
   - Security plugins blocking tracking
   - Privacy plugins interfering
   - Other analytics plugins causing conflicts

## Solution

### Step 1: Check Tracking Method

1. Go to WordPress Admin > Settings > WP Statistics > Settings
2. Navigate to the "Tracking" tab
3. Recommended settings:
   - Enable "Use JavaScript Client" for best compatibility with caching
   - Enable "Track All Pages"
   - Disable "Don't track admin pages" (unless desired)

### Step 2: Check Caching Plugin Compatibility

For **WP Rocket**:
1. Go to WP Rocket settings
2. Navigate to "File Optimization"
3. Add WP Statistics JavaScript to excluded files
4. Clear cache

For **W3 Total Cache**:
1. Go to Performance > Page Cache
2. Add WP Statistics JavaScript to "Never cache the following pages"
3. Purge all caches

For **Other Caching Plugins**:
1. Ensure JavaScript tracking is enabled in WP Statistics
2. Exclude WP Statistics JavaScript from minification/combination
3. Clear all caches

### Step 3: Verify You're Not Excluded

1. Check Settings > WP Statistics > Exclusions
2. Verify:
   - Your IP is not in the excluded IPs list
   - Your browser/user agent is not excluded
   - You're not logged in as admin (if admins are excluded)

### Step 4: Test Tracking

1. Open your website in an incognito/private browser window
2. Visit several pages
3. Wait 1-2 minutes
4. Check WP Statistics dashboard for new visits

### Step 5: Check Browser Console

1. Open your site in a browser
2. Open Developer Tools (F12)
3. Go to Console tab
4. Look for any JavaScript errors related to WP Statistics
5. Check Network tab to verify tracking requests are being sent

### Step 6: Database Check

1. Go to WP Statistics > Optimization
2. Run database optimization
3. Check if database tables exist and are accessible

### Step 7: Privacy & GDPR Settings

1. Check Settings > WP Statistics > Privacy
2. If using consent management:
   - Verify consent banner is showing
   - Confirm consent is being recorded
   - Test tracking after accepting cookies

### Step 8: Plugin Conflicts

1. Temporarily deactivate other security/analytics plugins
2. Test if tracking works
3. Reactivate one at a time to identify conflicts

## Prevention

- Configure caching plugins to exclude WP Statistics from the start
- Keep WP Statistics updated
- Test tracking after installing new plugins
- Regularly check the dashboard to ensure tracking is working
- Document any custom exclusion rules
