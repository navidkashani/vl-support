# License Activation Template - WP Statistics

Hi [USER_NAME],

Thanks for reaching out! I'd be happy to help you activate your WP Statistics license.

The process is straightforward - here's what you need to do:

**Step 1: Log in to your account**
Go to [wp-statistics.com](https://wp-statistics.com) and sign in with your credentials.

**Step 2: Manage your domain**
Once logged in, go to the **Downloads** section. For each add-on or product you purchased, you'll see a **Domain Manager** option. Click on it and enter the website URL where you want to use the plugin.

**Step 3: Copy your license key**
After adding your domain, copy the license key that appears for that add-on.

**Step 4: Activate in WordPress**
1. Log in to your WordPress dashboard
2. Go to **Statistics &rarr; Add-ons**
3. Find the add-on you want to activate
4. Paste your license key in the License field
5. Click **Update License** to activate

That's it! Your add-on should now be activated and ready to use.

**Note**: You can also download the add-on files from the Downloads section if you haven't installed them yet.

If you run into any issues or have questions about any of these steps, just let me know and I'll be happy to help!

Best regards,
